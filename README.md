# UFO's
## Overview
Being able to search on multiple variables makes for a better user experience and provides a more robust way to gather the data desired.  Therefore, the UFO website was built to provide the viewer the ability to filter on several factors in order to refine their search criteria.

## Filters
All the filters have default entries to ensure proper formatting when entering a filter criteria.
*Enter Date* : This filters on the date on which the sighting occurred.
*Enter a City* : Enter a City in the same format as the default criteria to pull only a specific City of a UFO sighting.
*Enter a State* : By entering a State, you can find all sightings that occurred in that State.
*Enter a Country* : Like State and City, you can also filter on the Country.
*Enter a Shape* : Shape is a bit different.  This will filter on the type of sighting; was it a circle in the sky, just a light, etc.

## Summary
This website is a versatile search of UFO sightings that occurred in the first 2 weeks of 2010. The versatility is based on the five search options; date, city, state, country, and shape.
